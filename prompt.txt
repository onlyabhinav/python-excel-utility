Create a Python-based Excel Utility with a GUI that allows users to interactively work with Excel files. The utility should include the following features:

1. File Selection:
   - Allow users to browse and select Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)
   - Display the selected filename

2. Sheet Management:
   - Show a dropdown of all available sheets in the Excel file
   - Allow users to select which sheet to work with

3. Column Selection:
   - Display all available columns from the selected sheet
   - Allow users to select multiple columns of interest
   - Include buttons to add/remove columns from selection

4. Save/Load Column Configurations:
   - Allow users to save their column selections with a name
   - Provide ability to load previously saved column configurations
   - Handle mismatches between saved configurations and current sheets

5. Data Display:
   - Show selected columns in a scrollable table/grid view
   - Implement proper scrolling for both horizontal and vertical navigation

6. Filtering Capabilities:
   - Filter data based on column values
   - Support multiple filter conditions (equals, contains, greater than, less than, starts with, ends with)
   - Make text-based filtering case-insensitive
   - Apply filters to the current view

7. Sorting Functionality:
   - Sort displayed data by any column
   - Support both ascending and descending sorting
   - Sort only the current filtered data (not the entire dataset)

8. Export Options:
   - Export the current view (with filters and sorting applied) to Excel or CSV
   - Generate intelligent filenames based on applied filters and sorts
   - Include abbreviations and date stamps in export filenames

9. Error Handling:
   - Implement robust error handling for file operations
   - Display user-friendly error messages

The UI should be intuitive with clearly labeled sections and a clean layout. Use tkinter for the GUI and pandas for Excel handling. Make sure all functions work together seamlessly (e.g., applying a filter and then sorting should maintain the filtered context).

Provide the complete Python code with proper documentation.
